        <h2>History on Cats</h2>
        <!--Introduction-->
        <p>It wasnâ€™t until 1983 that we even had the first inkling of cat domestication, when a cat jawbone was located
            in Cyprus during an archaeological dig and they estimated that domestication had occurred 8,000 years ago.
            Researchers thought this cat must have been domesticated because the only way a cat could have got to the
            island was via a ship with humans, and it was incredibly unlikely that they would have been able to bring
            cats which were completely wild along with them.
            Further research in 2004 set the origin of cat domestication back even further as according to The
            Smithsonian, a cat was found purposefully buried with a human, which was thought to be 9,500 years old.</p>
